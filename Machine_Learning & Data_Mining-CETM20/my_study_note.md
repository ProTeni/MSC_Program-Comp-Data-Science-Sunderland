You're correct—hyperparameters can be grouped by their impact on preprocessing, model architecture, optimization, and regularization. Here’s a summary of how each group helps with **overfitting** or **underfitting**, and when to use them:

---

### 1. **Preprocessing Hyperparameters**
- **Standardization/Normalization:**  
  - *Purpose:* Ensures features are on similar scales, helping optimization.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (by making training easier), but not directly with overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Data features have different scales or distributions.

---

### 2. **Model Architecture Hyperparameters**
- **Type of Model (Dense, CNN, RNN, Transformer):**  
  - *Purpose:* Matches model to data type (images, text, etc.).
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (if model is too simple), overfitting (if model is too complex).
  - *Use when:* Data type changes or model is not learning well.

- **Number of Layers/Neurons:**  
  - *Purpose:* Controls model capacity.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (increase layers/neurons), overfitting (decrease layers/neurons).
  - *Use when:* Model is too simple (underfit) or too complex (overfit).

- **Activation Function:**  
  - *Purpose:* Adds non-linearity.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (choose better activation), not directly with overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Model can't capture complex patterns.

---

### 3. **Optimization Hyperparameters**
- **Learning Rate:**  
  - *Purpose:* Controls step size in optimization.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (increase if learning is slow), overfitting (decrease if model jumps to bad minima).
  - *Use when:* Loss stagnates or oscillates.

- **Batch Size:**  
  - *Purpose:* Number of samples per gradient update.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (smaller batch can help generalization), overfitting (larger batch can stabilize).
  - *Use when:* Training is unstable or slow.

- **Epochs:**  
  - *Purpose:* Number of passes through data.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (increase epochs), overfitting (decrease epochs).
  - *Use when:* Model hasn't learned enough or starts to overfit.

- **Loss Function/Metric:**  
  - *Purpose:* Guides optimization.
  - *Helps with:* Underfitting (choose appropriate loss), not directly with overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Task changes (classification vs regression).

---

### 4. **Regularization Hyperparameters**
- **Dropout:**  
  - *Purpose:* Randomly drops neurons during training.
  - *Helps with:* Overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Validation loss diverges from training loss.

- **L1/L2 Regularization:**  
  - *Purpose:* Penalizes large weights.
  - *Helps with:* Overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Model memorizes training data.

- **Early Stopping:**  
  - *Purpose:* Stops training when validation loss increases.
  - *Helps with:* Overfitting.
  - *Use when:* Validation loss starts to rise.

## **Mapping Hyperparameters to Problems**

| Problem         | Hyperparameter Lever(s) to Use                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Overfitting     | Regularization (Dropout, L1/L2), Early Stopping, Reduce Model Size, Reduce Epochs |
| Underfitting    | Increase Model Size, More Layers/Neurons, Change Activation, Increase Epochs, Adjust Learning Rate |
| Poor Generalization | Regularization, Data Augmentation, Better Preprocessing, Early Stopping |
| Training Loss Stagnates | Change Learning Rate, More Epochs, Better Preprocessing |
| Validation Loss Diverges | Regularization, Reduce Model Complexity, Early Stopping |

Here’s an in-depth, practical guide for choosing the right model for different machine learning use-cases:

---

## 1. Tabular/Classical Data

**Typical Data:**  
- Rows = samples, columns = features (e.g. spreadsheets, CSVs, databases)
- Examples: customer info, medical records, sensor readings

**Common Models:**
- **Logistic Regression:**  
  - For binary classification (yes/no, true/false)
  - Fast, interpretable, works well if data is linearly separable
- **Linear Regression:**  
  - For predicting continuous values (e.g. house prices)
- **Decision Trees:**  
  - Handles non-linear relationships, easy to interpret
- **Random Forest:**  
  - Ensemble of decision trees, robust to overfitting, handles missing data well
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):**  
  - Powerful for tabular data, often wins competitions, but less interpretable
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine):**  
  - Good for small/medium datasets, can handle non-linear boundaries with kernels
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**  
  - Simple, non-parametric, but slow for large datasets

**When to use what?**
- **Start simple:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **If accuracy is low:** Try Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **If data is small:** SVM can be very effective
- **If interpretability is needed:** Decision Tree, Logistic Regression

## 2. Text Data (Natural Language Processing)

**Typical Data:**  
- Sentences, documents, tweets, reviews

**Common Models:**
- **Bag-of-Words + Logistic Regression/SVM:**  
  - Good baseline for text classification
- **Naive Bayes:**  
  - Fast, simple, works well for spam detection, sentiment analysis
- **TF-IDF + SVM/Logistic Regression:**  
  - Improves feature representation for text
- **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):**  
  - Handles sequences, good for text generation, translation
- **LSTM/GRU:**  
  - Improved RNNs for longer sequences
- **Transformers (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa):**  
  - State-of-the-art for most NLP tasks, but require more resources

**When to use what?**
- **Small datasets:** Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression
- **Sequence tasks (translation, summarization):** RNNs, LSTM/GRU, Transformers
- **Large datasets or need best accuracy:** Transformers

## 5. General Tips

- **Start simple:**  
  - Use interpretable models first (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- **Baseline:**  
  - Always compare complex models to a simple baseline
- **Cross-validation:**  
  - Use to estimate model performance reliably
- **Feature engineering:**  
  - Often more important than model choice
- **Try multiple models:**  
  - Use GridSearchCV or similar to compare

**Remember:**  
- There is no single best model for all cases ("No Free Lunch" theorem).
- Try several, compare with cross-validation, and pick the best for your data and problem.
